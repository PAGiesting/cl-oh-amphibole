# cl-oh-amphibole

This repo is meant to complement and extend Giesting and Filiberto (2014) in American Mineralogist on chlorine partitioning between melt and amphiboles. To start with, I have reproduced the recommended regression from that paper using statsmodels, and then shown that I did not select the optimal features, and in fact made a very questionable decision in selecting a model with no constant term for the paper.

My eventual intention was to bring the model up to date with additional synthesis data and other results from the literature. We'll see if that happens.
