# cl-oh-amphibole

This repo is meant to complement and extend Giesting and Filiberto (2014) in American Mineralogist on chlorine partitioning between melt and amphiboles. To start with, I have reproduced the recommended regression from that paper using statsmodels. My intention is to bring the model up to date with additional synthesis data and other results from the literature.
